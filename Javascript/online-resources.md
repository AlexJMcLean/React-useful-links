# Online Resources

There are a number of online resources that are of high quality to learn Javascript or find out about specific topics.

## General Resources

  Eric Elliott is a strong proponent of Javascript, has written numerous articles about learning and understanding Javascript, and assembled some very useful lists of numerous Javascript resources. (Note that he is very strongly opinionated in his own articles, particularly about certain code patterns that he feels everyone should follow, but overall his advice and information is pretty solid.)
